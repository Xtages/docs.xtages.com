An Xtages project corresponds to a GitHub repository (under your GitHub organization) and includes Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines out-of-the-box.

## Creating a Project

Projects are created from templates that are available under the [consoleâ€™s home page](https://console.xtages.com/). When a new project is created a corresponding **private** [GitHub repository](/github) will be created. Pushes to the main branch of the repository will run the CI pipeline for the project.
