Xtages lets you create projects that include out-of-the-box Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines. It integrates with GitHub to provide CI workflows and deploys your applications to two environments; staging and production.


## Getting started

Once you have [signed up to Xtages](https://www.xtages.com/pricing.html) and installed our [GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/xtages-connector) on your GitHub organization you can then start [creating your application](projects/) using one of our project templates.

Your application will have an out-of-the-box CI workflow that is run on every push to your main [GitHub](/github) branch, additionally, a CD workflow is available to deploy your application to the staging environment as well as promote a build from staging to production.
