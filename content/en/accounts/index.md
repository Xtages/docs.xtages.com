When a user [signs up](https://console.xtages.com/signup) an organization in Xtages, they become the organization’s owner, meaning that they can manage the billing details for the subscription and the organization’s users.

## Inviting users

An owner can invite new users to the organization by going to the Account page.

When a user is invited, a random password will be generated for them that is valid for seven days and can only be used once. When a user accepts the invitation, they are forced to change their one-time-use password.
