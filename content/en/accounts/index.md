When a user [signs up](https://console.xtages.com/signup) an organization in Xtages, they become the organization’s owner, meaning that they can manage the billing details for the subscription and the organization’s users.

## Inviting users

An owner can invite new users to the organization by going to the Account page.

When a user is invited, they will receive an invitation email with a one-time-use randomly generated password that they can use to [log into the console](https://console.xtages.com/login). Upon logging in with this password, they will be forced to change it.
