# docs.xtages.com

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [docsy theme](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/).

# Getting started

## Requisited

In order to develop this site you will need:

* A [recent **extended** version](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) of Hugo.
* [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## One-time setup

* Clone this repository.
* Run `git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1`
* Run `npm install` inside the root of the repository.

## Development

This is a pretty standard installation of Hugo, so content is created using Markdown inside the
[content/en](./content/en) directory.

To test out your changes, run `hugo serve` from the root of the repository.
